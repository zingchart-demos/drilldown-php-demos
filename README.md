# PHP Drilldown Demos

## File Structure

The `vendor` folder contains the code for the [zingchart-php](https://github.com/zingchart/zingchart-php) wrapper.

Each of the `url_` prefixed folders contains a demo. Within each folder is a README and an `index.php` for you to both view the demos and learn how to create drilldown charts with our PHP wrapper.

The most viable demo, in our opinion, is the service layer drilldown but all are acceptable and dependent on project requirements, time and programming abilities.
